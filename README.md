# F1-Web-Scraper
### Web scraper to collect data from the F1 website

Using python with the *request* and *Beautiful Soup* libraries, statistics are scraped from the official [F1 website](https://www.formula1.com/) and formatted into usable data. Graphs will be created to plot season progression, driver careers, lap times etc. Website and hopefully an app will display this information to the users.

<br/>

Planned data uses:
* Season progression - graphs showing the accumulation of each driver's and team's points over the chosen season
* Driver career - graphs showing a driver's wins, points etc over their career
* Team career - graphs showing a team's wins, points etc over their career
* Track history - graphs showing laptimes and usage over seasons
